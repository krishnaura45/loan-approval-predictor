## Introduction
This repository contains my solution for the Kaggle competition [Playground Series - Season 4, Episode 10](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e10). The objective is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application will be approved, based on various applicant features.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Financial institutions need accurate tools to determine the creditworthiness of applicants. This project aims to automate loan approval decisions using supervised classification algorithms with ROC AUC Score as the evaluation metric.

## Workflow
- 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- 🧠 Model Training (baseline + ensemble)
- 🧪 ROC-AUC Evaluation
- 📊 Feature Importance & Interpretability
- 📝 Submission File Generation

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
- SHAP for model interpretability
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Performance
Achieved strong ROC AUC score with a stacked ensemble of gradient boosting models and logistic regression as meta-learner.

<!--## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna
- Deep learning model experimentation
- Deployment of a loan approval web app-->
